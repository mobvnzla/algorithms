## Divide and conquer

> In computer science, divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm. A divide-and-conquer algorithm ==recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems== of the same or related type, until these become ==simple enough to be solved directly.== The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

## In-place algorithm

> In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure. However, a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables. The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes.
>
> An in-place algorithm updates its input sequence only through replacement or swapping of elements. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.
