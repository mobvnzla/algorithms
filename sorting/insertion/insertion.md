#An example of selection sort.

Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and grows a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.

The partial sorted list initially contains only the first element in the list. With each iteration one element is removed from the "not yet checked for order" input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list.
